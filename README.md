# metaclo

This marketplace is a clothing distribuited store where anyone can upload their own image of the garment. This store aims to trace each garment in order to facilitate the verification of authenticity, the exchange and the protection of each consumer.

The market has 3 pages: index.html, myItems.html, newCreation.html. 
Each of these pages is conveyed by its own script: for index there is app.js; for myItems there is myItems.js; for newCreation there is newOne.js;

## index.html
Is the main page where a user can view, select and/or purchase items created by other users.

## myItems
In this section you will find all the items you own, whether they are bought or created by you.

## newCreation
Finally there is the newly created section where any user can have fun creating items. New creations are immediately visible in the myItems section. In the phase of creating a new item, the user has the possibility to put his item up for sale, this implies that a user other than the owner can buy the item immediately after submitting the payment of a "share" in addition to the payment of the gas fee by the owner.
